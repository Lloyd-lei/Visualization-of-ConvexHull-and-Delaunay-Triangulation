    ========== Conclusions on Convex Hull Algorithms' Runtimes ==========
    Observations:
    1. Graham Scan: Typically O(n log n). For large n, it should outpace Jarvis March (which can be O(nh)).
    2. Jarvis March: Complexity can reach O(nh). If hull size is significant, this can be slower on large n.
    3. QuickHull: Average O(n log n), but worst-case can degrade to O(n^2). On random data, it usually performs quite well.
    4. Monotone Chain (Andrew's Algorithm): O(n log n), often straightforward and efficient for uniformly distributed points.

    In practice (as the plot shows), the three O(n log n) algorithms (Graham Scan, QuickHull, Monotone Chain) might have similar scaling,
    while Jarvis March can be slower if the hull is large. However, for small or moderate n, differences may not be huge.

    The exact lines in the plot could vary based on implementation details, constants, and random distribution, but we typically expect:
    - Jarvis March might show a steeper growth with n (depending on distribution).
    - The other three keep pace with each other for large n, with possible small differences in constant factors.
