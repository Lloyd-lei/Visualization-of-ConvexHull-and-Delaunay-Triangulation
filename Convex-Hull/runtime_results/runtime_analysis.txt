The four convex hull algorithms exhibit different performance characteristics in the experiment, but their behaviors align with their theoretical time complexities. All algorithms show an increase in runtime as the number of input points, `n`, grows. **Graham Scan and Jarvis March have the longest runtimes, while QuickHull and Monotone Chain are faster and more stable.** Graham Scan relies on sorting by polar angle, leading to an `O(n log n)` complexity, which results in a steep runtime curve dominated by sorting operations. Jarvis March has a time complexity of `O(nh)`, where `h` represents the number of points on the convex hull. Consequently, its runtime is higher under the uniform distribution `[-5,5]` than under the Gaussian distribution `(-1,1)`, indicating that `h` tends to increase in a larger range, slowing the algorithmâ€™s performance. QuickHull maintains a near `O(n log n)` complexity in this experiment but can be even faster for smaller `n`, approaching `O(n)`, due to its recursive partitioning method. Monotone Chain also has an `O(n log n)` complexity but consistently outperforms Graham Scan and Jarvis March due to its simpler implementation, maintaining efficient execution across different distributions. Under the Gaussian distribution, Jarvis March performs better than under uniform distributions, likely because the convex hull size `h` remains relatively small. In contrast, under the `[-5,5]` uniform distribution, `h` may be larger, causing Jarvis March to approach `O(n^2)` behavior. Additionally, Graham Scan exhibits a runtime drop between `n=800` and `n=1000`, which may be attributed to CPU scheduling optimizations, data distribution affecting sorting efficiency, or Python interpreter Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation effects. Overall, QuickHull and Monotone Chain are the preferred choices for large-scale point cloud data, while Jarvis March performs well only when `h` is small. Graham Scan, with its high sorting overhead, becomes slower as `n` increases. The experimental results align with expectations, highlighting the significant influence of the convex hull size `h` across different distributions.
